### 🧭 Summary of Contents:

Based on _Itinerarium Mentis in Deum_ by St. Bonaventure

- A sixfold path of mystical ascent toward union with God, mirrored in the six wings of the Seraph seen by St. Francis
    
- Three tiers of contemplation: through the **senses** (external world), **imagination and intellect** (internal reasoning), and **divine light** (transcendent union)
    
- The created world as a **mirror of divine truth**—traces of God visible in proportion, number, and beauty
    
- True contemplation requires purification of soul, prayer, virtue, and active ascension of faculties
    
- The **seventh step** is a resting state: mystical union beyond intellect, a complete surrender into the divine presence

### 🔍 Key Concepts Preserved:

- The soul contains ascending faculties: sense → imagination → reason → intellect → intelligence → synderesis
    
- These must be reformed by grace, illuminated by divine truth, and ultimately quieted in contemplative rest
    
- Christ is the ladder and door of ascent—symbolic of the need for a mediator or model for upward movement
    
- All created things bear the imprint of the divine: **beauty, order, and radiance**
